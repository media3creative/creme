          %p Gorgeous Brazilian Hair, slightly processed to achieve this beautiful classic body wave texture. This hair is full of body, and has the dreamy "S" type wave that gives body and vitality to your hairstyle. You'll love how these waves look and feel. This is Brazilian hair that is steam permed to artificially create the lovely curl pattern you see. The steaming process is completely chemical free, water is used to steam the hair into shape. The texture may not be as flexible as virgin hair, meaning the hair may not revert back to a natural wavy pattern after an extended period of use. 
          %ul
            %li Weight: 4 oz.
            %li Color: Black (#1) and Dark Brown (#2)
            %li Weft: Machine Weft
            %li Styling: 2 bundles are recommended for a full weave for hair less than 22''. This will ensure you have enough hair rather than not enough. For hair longer that 22'' you may need a third bundle to achieve the look you are looking for. The hair will be longer but the width of the track will be shorter. I If you do not use all the hair you can use the remaining for your next install or touch up.
            %li Life span: This hair will last up to 6 months with proper care and maintenance.

          %p Virgin Indian Hair is one of the most beautiful, rarest, and most expensive hair your money can buy. It is highly regarded in the hair industry because of its flexibility, durability, and texture. Indian hair is naturally thick and lustrous. The natural variation, strength, and beauty of Indian hair make it the preferred choice for celebrities, stylists, and women of all ethnicities. It is simply the best quality hair extensions on the market.
          %p At Creme de-la Creme Hair our Virgin Indian Remy Hair comes from the temples in India where women shave their hair for religious reasons. Since the majorities of Indian women do not color, process, or chemically alter their hair, virgin Indian hair is the most natural luxurious hair extension type available. Our South Indian supplier has over thirty-five years of experience in manufacturing and supplying the finest human hair products, containing pure, untreated human hair from Indian donors.
          %p Creme de-la Creme Virgin Indian Hair is strong hair that is naturally straight, wavy or curly. The waviness can be easily turned into curly with proper styling. It comes in natural colors of dark brown (#2) or natural black (#1b). The hair can be relaxed, permed, and colored. Our lengths range from 12''-26''.

          %h1 Hair Extension Length Tips:
          %ul{:style => "color: white;"}
            %li When choosing hair please keep in mind that Virgin Single Drawn hair is left completely natural at the ends. It may be a good idea to select a slightly longer length because some trimming may be needed.
            %br
            %li Straight Virgin hair is true to its' length. However, wavy and curly hair is usually 1.5" shorter when the hair is worn wavy or curly. Therefore, we often suggest customers to purchase hair 2" longer if they desire a wavy or curly hair look.
